## Overview

A field-friendly hay planning calculator for estimating how much hay a herd may require over a chosen feeding period, how many bales that represents, whether current inventory is sufficient, and what the projected purchase cost may be.

Hay Needs Calculator is one of the standalone tools in the RanchAssist ecosystem. The product is designed around a focused workflow: open the tool for the ranch job in front of you, enter or map the information that matters, review assumptions and calculations, and leave with a result that can be saved, exported, printed, copied, or shared.

The tool is intended to feel like practical field-operations software rather than a general ranch-management platform. It does not require a RanchAssist account and does not depend on a shared RanchAssist project database.

## Key capabilities

- Create multiple livestock groups with head count, average weight, and dry-matter-intake assumptions.
- Enter the feeding period by date range or total feeding days.
- Add severe-weather and reserve days.
- Configure round, large square, small square, or custom bales.
- Enter bale weight, dry matter, price, storage loss, feeding/refusal waste, and bales on hand.
- Optionally model multiple hay types with ration-share percentages.
- Estimate bales/day, week, month, reserve requirement, inventory shortage/surplus, total cost, cost/head/day, and depletion date.
- Show a consumption/inventory view that is easy to use during feed planning.

## Typical workflow

1. Define the livestock groups.
2. Choose the feeding period and reserve/weather buffer.
3. Enter hay/bale assumptions and current inventory.
4. Add multiple hay types or ration shares if needed.
5. Review total tons/bales, inventory gap, depletion timing, and cost.
6. Save the editable project or export/share the feeding summary.

## Calculation / measurement model

- Daily herd dry-matter demand is the sum of head × average weight × intake percentage for all groups.
- As-fed hay converts dry-matter demand using the hay dry-matter percentage.
- Loss-adjusted requirement applies user-entered storage and feeding/refusal loss assumptions.
- Whole-bale requirement rounds the calculated hay mass upward based on average bale weight.
- Inventory shortage/surplus compares required bales with current bales on hand.
- Projected cost is based on the required/purchased bale quantities and user-entered prices.

Important formulas and assumptions should be available in the UI through **Calculation Details** or the equivalent audit view. RanchAssist favors transparent calculations over opaque outputs, and user-editable defaults should be treated as planning examples rather than universal recommendations.

## Project state

A saved RanchAssist `.ra` file for this tool should preserve enough information to resume meaningful editing, including herd groups, feeding period, hay types, bale assumptions, inventory, reserve settings, advanced mode, ration shares, notes, and cost assumptions.

Every `.ra` project should include the shared RanchAssist project metadata: project UUID, project name, originating tool ID, tool version, `.ra` format version, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, editable state, and spatial state where applicable. After opening a project, derived values should be recalculated using the current application logic rather than blindly trusting previously saved calculated totals.

## Export and sharing

Supported/expected outputs for this tool include:

- `.ra` project file
- PDF / print feeding summary
- CSV livestock/hay table
- Copy Summary
- Email summary

Report-oriented outputs should include the tool name, project name when supplied, important inputs, assumptions, calculations, key results, warnings/notes, and a timestamp. Spatial reports should include the relevant map or plan image when practical.

## Project files, session data, and privacy

RanchAssist uses a **session-first, user-controlled persistence model**.

- No RanchAssist account is required for the standalone tool.
- `sessionStorage` may protect active work from an accidental refresh or same-tab interruption.
- `localStorage` is not used as permanent project storage.
- RanchAssist does not permanently store the user's ranch/project data by default.
- **Save Project** creates a user-controlled `.ra` RanchAssist Project File containing the editable project state.
- **Open Project** restores a compatible `.ra` file after validation.
- **Duplicate Project** creates a new project lineage with a new project UUID.
- **Clear Session / Start Over** clears active browser-session data without deleting `.ra` files or exports already saved on the user's device.

A `.ra` file is distinct from report/data exports. PDF, CSV, PNG, GeoJSON, print output, email, and copied summaries are for communication or interoperability; `.ra` is for resuming the editable project.

Imported project files are data, not executable code. The application must not execute imported JavaScript, use `eval`, restore secrets, or inject unsanitized imported HTML.


## Runtime configuration

No third-party API is required for the core hay calculations. Email sharing uses Apps Script `MailApp`. Deployment settings belong in Script Properties rather than in user project data.

RanchAssist administrators configure developer infrastructure; normal users should never be asked to paste API keys, Mapbox tokens, OAuth secrets, or other developer credentials into the tool.

## Architecture

This repository follows the RanchAssist standalone-tool architecture:

- **Primary deployment:** Google Apps Script Web App.
- **Frontend:** semantic HTML5, componentized CSS, and lightweight client-side JavaScript.
- **Dependencies:** kept intentionally minimal so the tool remains maintainable and field-friendly.
- **Responsive behavior:** desktop, tablet, and phone are treated as distinct layouts rather than a desktop interface simply being scaled down.
- **Accessibility:** real form labels, keyboard-operable controls, visible focus states, plain-language validation, WCAG-AA-minded contrast, and large mobile touch targets.
- **Server responsibilities:** server-only operations such as email sharing or private API calls stay in Apps Script rather than exposing secrets in the browser.

The application should remain independently usable and deployable. It does not depend on a shared RanchAssist account system or a cross-tool project database.


## Suggested repository structure

The exact filenames may vary by release, but a RanchAssist repository should stay intentionally small and understandable. A common Apps Script layout is:

```text
.
├── Code.gs                 # Apps Script backend / runtime configuration / email share
├── Index.html              # Main UI (often self-contained HTML + CSS + client JS)
├── appsscript.json         # Apps Script manifest, when managed in source
├── README.md               # Repository documentation
└── README_SETUP.txt        # Deployment/configuration notes when distributed as source files
```

Some releases may include separate style/app partials or a standalone HTML build when that materially improves maintainability or portability. Keep secrets out of all client-side files.


## Google Apps Script deployment

A typical deployment flow is:

1. Create or open the Google Apps Script project for this repository.
2. Add the repository's Apps Script backend and HTML frontend files.
3. Configure any required **Script Properties** listed in the Runtime Configuration section below.
4. Save the project.
5. Choose **Deploy → New deployment → Web app**.
6. Select the execution/access settings appropriate for the RanchAssist deployment.
7. Authorize required Apps Script services, such as `MailApp`, when email sharing is enabled.
8. Deploy and verify the public RanchAssist subdomain routes to the current web-app deployment.

Do not put private API keys directly in frontend HTML or JavaScript. Script Properties are the canonical configuration store for Apps Script deployments.


## Design system

The UI follows the RanchAssist visual standard: modern field-operations software, monochrome-first surfaces, warm off-white canvas, near-black text, thin borders, restrained functional color, compact controls, strong alignment, minimal decorative effects, and responsive layouts designed for real use from a phone, tablet, pickup, barn, pasture, or ranch office.

Key UX expectations include:

- Results should be understandable quickly.
- Units should always be explicit.
- Assumptions should appear near the inputs they affect.
- Advanced settings should stay out of the way of the primary workflow.
- Validation should explain both the problem and how to fix it.
- Destructive actions such as Clear Session should require an appropriate confirmation when meaningful work exists.
- Status should never rely on color alone.
- Mobile layouts should favor large controls, limited typing, stacked sections/bottom sheets, and early visibility of the primary result.

## Safety and limitations

Hay requirements are planning estimates based on user-entered weights, intake, dry matter, waste, weather/reserve days, and bale characteristics. Actual animal needs and forage quality vary; the calculator is not a veterinary or nutritional prescription.

RanchAssist should use language such as **estimate**, **planning estimate**, **projected requirement**, **mapped measurement**, and **user-defined scenario**. Avoid presenting results as guaranteed, certified, surveyed, engineered, legally compliant, veterinarian-approved, or otherwise authoritative beyond what the user's inputs and the tool's calculations support.

## QA checklist

Before publishing a release, verify at minimum:

- [ ] Core calculations or map interactions work on desktop, tablet, and phone.
- [ ] Required, Optional, Advanced, and Assumption inputs are clearly identified where applicable.
- [ ] Units are always visible and conversions are consistent.
- [ ] Invalid values produce a clear explanation and a corrective action.
- [ ] Calculation details/formulas are available where the tool performs calculations.
- [ ] `.ra` Save Project creates a valid project file.
- [ ] A saved `.ra` file can be opened after Clear Session and restores editable state.
- [ ] Wrong-tool, corrupt, or unsupported `.ra` files fail safely.
- [ ] Derived results are recalculated after a project is reopened.
- [ ] Refresh recovery works through `sessionStorage` without implying permanent saving.
- [ ] Clear Session does not delete local `.ra` or report exports.
- [ ] Print/PDF output is readable and includes key assumptions/results.
- [ ] CSV output opens cleanly in standard spreadsheet software when CSV is supported.
- [ ] Copy Summary produces concise, useful plain text.
- [ ] Email sharing works without exposing server-side credentials.
- [ ] No private credential appears in page source, browser storage, `.ra` files, exports, or logs.
- [ ] Mobile controls meet practical touch-target and field-use requirements.


## Development principles

When extending this repository:

1. Keep the tool focused on its core ranch job.
2. Preserve the no-account, standalone architecture unless an approved RanchAssist source-of-truth explicitly changes it.
3. Keep project persistence user-controlled through `.ra` files rather than adding silent cloud or long-term browser storage.
4. Keep deployment configuration separate from user project state.
5. Never serialize secrets or executable code into `.ra` files.
6. Use an explicit allowlist when exposing browser-safe runtime configuration.
7. Keep calculations auditable and assumptions editable.
8. Recalculate derived values after restoring saved projects.
9. Design mobile behavior intentionally rather than shrinking desktop layouts.
10. Update this README whenever major capabilities, configuration requirements, project-state schema, or public URLs change.
